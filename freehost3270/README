FreeHost 3270 version 0.1 README

01/17/2002 - Fixed the notorious 'GraphicsEnvironment' issue for
Windows folks (and condemned UNIX users to the awful Java fonts :-).

What works:

The TN3270 Emulator applet, the SessionServer servlet, and the
RightHost3270 servlet (the one that delivers the emulator applet), all
seem to work ok.

What doesn't work: (Developers, please feel free to jump in...)

* Print - There's a print option in the File menu of the
applet... this opens a new browser window, but doesn't do
anything... it 'should' post the contents of the current screen back
to a PrintServlet, so the user can print using his browser.  STATUS:
Fixed in next release

* HTML 'Screen Scrape' - The source is in the tree, but the
distribution doesn't have it enabled.  STATUS: Tested and enabled in
next release.

* Encryption - Stripped out commercial encryption libraries for
release under LGPL.  STATUS: Fixed in a future release.

* Load Balancing - Removed.  STATUS: Gone forever unless I'm convinced
that enough users want it.


REALLY QUICK START

Assuming you already have Java Servlet 2.2 compliant container, copy
the freehost3270.war file to the container's ./webapps directory.
Most containers will auto-deploy your war... if yours doesn't, you'll
need to restart it.

goto http://<wherever your container is>/freehost3270/freehost

You should see the FreeHost3270 Java Emulator pop up and connect to
Harvard's HOLLIS server.

Did it work?  Great.  No?  Sorry.  Either way, you should probably
have a gander at the documentation in ./docs/freehost.html
