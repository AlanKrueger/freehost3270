FreeHost 3270 version 0.1 README

REALLY QUICK START

Assuming you already have Java Servlet 2.2 compliant container, copy the freehost3270.war
file to the container's ./webapps directory.  Most containers will auto-deploy your 
war... if yours doesn't, you'll need to restart it.

goto http://<wherever your container is>/freehost3270/freehost

You should see the FreeHost3270 Java Emulator pop up and connect to Harvard's HOLLIS server.

Did it work?  Great.  No?  Sorry.  Either way, you should probably have a gander at the documentation in ./docs/freehost.html
