Free Host 3270 version 0.2-CURRENT README.

What works:

The TN3270 Emulator applet, the SessionServer servlet, and the
Free Host 3270 servlet (the one that delivers the emulator applet), all
seem to work ok.

What doesn't work: (Developers, please feel free to jump in...)

* Print -The screen may get clipped at the edges because the margin settings 
are difficult to work with. Look for a fix soon!

* HTML 'Screen Scrape' - The source is in the tree, but the
distribution doesn't have it enabled.  STATUS: Tested and enabled in
next release.

REALLY QUICK START

Assuming you already have Java Servlet 2.2 compliant container, copy
the freehost3270.war file to the container's ./webapps directory.
Most containers will auto-deploy your war... if yours doesn't, you'll
need to restart it.

goto http://<wherever your container is>/freehost3270/freehost

You should see the FreeHost3270 Java Emulator pop up and connect to
Harvard's HOLLIS server.

Did it work?  Great.  No?  Sorry.  Either way, you should probably
have a gander at the documentation in ./docs/freehost.html
